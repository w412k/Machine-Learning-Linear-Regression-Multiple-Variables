# Machine Learning With Python: Linear Regression Multiple Variables

This repository contains a practice exercise for implementing multiple linear regression using Python for predicting employee salaries. The exercise focuses on building a model that estimates the salary of employees based on three independent variables: experience, test score, and interview score.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this exercise is a custom practice dataset about hiring employees. It includes the following features:

- Experience: The number of years of experience the employee has.
- Test Score: The score obtained by the employee in a test conducted during the hiring process.
- Interview Score: The score obtained by the employee in the interview process.

The target variable is the employee's salary.
